        - Send a simple "Hello" message

        - Take information printed to the console, find a way to store it, and send a message
        - Develop a system to automatically parse new slides

## Mid-January - February: -> Feature #3
- Goal: Discord server moderation
    - ### Tasks:
    - Create a dummy Discord account and add it to our server
    - Create code to kick out the dummy Discord account using `discord.py`
    - **SPIKE:** Investigate a way to print the email address associated with the Discord account
        - Idea: Create a Google login where you log in to a UFL account. If successful, input the email associated with the account and add it to a DB collection. Cross-compare usernames in the set and, if not found, remove the account.
